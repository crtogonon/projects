    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to predict the NBA performance for the college basketball players entering the 2017 NBA draft. To do this, I first needed to webscrape DraftExpress.com and Sports-Reference.com and parse through the HTML using BeautifulSoup in order to get all of my player data. After cleaning the data and dealing with missing values, I tested a number of different models in order to determine the best one. After choosing the model I tuned it using Gridsearch to find the best parameters, and then used it to make predictions for the draft class."

    "Of the 1304 players in my training set, 466 were \"bad\", 709 were \"average\", and 129 were \"good\". I know that these classes were imbalanced but I felt that it was appropriate because adjusting the ranges for classes would make me lose the meaning behind the classifications. Also, the distribution makes sense to me because in the real world, the number of good players is definitely a lot lower than the number of average players in the league.\n",

One route I can take, is to try to find a way to expand the scope of my model to include players who did not go to college. For players who played overseas, I would need to figure out a way to normalize their stats with college stats. For player who went straight to the NBA after high school, I would need to find a way to normalize their high school stats as well. Doing these things would help by expanding my data and giving my model more information to train on. However, I feel that the way to expand the data the most is only by waiting. I learned while doing this project that there really isn't that much data to work with regarding this topic. Unfortunately it looks like we would have to wait through the years until enough players have played in the league to provide a large enough dataset to build a very good model on.\n",

For my missing values, I can either look for sources to find the missing data or figure out a good way to impute them. I could also try finding other variables to add to the model. One example of a variable I would like to add is the strength of schedule numbers for the players' college careers."
