    "## Problem statement:\n",
    "I will be working with data that I web scraped from indeed.com for data science job postings. The goal is to clean the data and build logistic regression models to predict whether or not jobs will give an applicant a high salary or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks and Assumptions:\n",
    "As you will see below, the data scraped from the website is not clean at all. A lot of work will spent on cleaning the data in each column and creating variables to put into the predictive models. Without more domain knowledge, the selection of variables and thresholds may not as accurate as they could be. Also, with such few postings that contain salary information, it may be more difficult to build an accurate model."

    "From the correlation matrix above, it appears that location is an important factor in determining the salary. Certain cities like New York, San Francisco, and surprisingly Charlotte look to have a correlation to high salaries. Also, whether the position is senior level or not seems to be a factor as well.\n",

    "As I mentioned earlier, the fact that there are not a lot of job postings with salary information makes it more difficult to build a strong model for predicting salary range. Also, considering the large number of features I used for my models, there is a chance that the models could be overfit for the data. In this situation it would be more beneficial if we had more salary data that we could use to fit,test, and cross validate a model on."
